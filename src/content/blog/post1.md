Great gardens start with healthy soil. Testing your soil’s pH and nutrient levels helps you know what amendments it needs. Adding organic compost improves soil texture and fertility, promoting strong root growth. Good drainage is also key—plants don’t like soggy roots! Mulching conserves moisture and keeps weeds at bay. By nurturing your soil, you create the perfect foundation for thriving plants. Remember, healthy soil means happy plants and a vibrant garden all year round.

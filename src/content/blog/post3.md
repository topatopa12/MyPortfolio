Watering your garden properly is essential for plant health. Early morning is the best time to water because it reduces evaporation and helps roots absorb moisture deeply. Avoid over watering, which can cause root rot, and under watering, which stresses plants. Using drip irrigation or soaker hoses delivers water directly to roots, saving water and reducing leaf diseases. 

Water Early or Late: The best times to water are early morning or late evening to minimize evaporation and help water reach the roots efficiently.

Deep Watering: Water deeply but infrequently to encourage deep root growth, which helps plants become more drought-tolerant.

Use Mulch: Applying mulch helps retain soil moisture, reduce evaporation, and keep roots cool.

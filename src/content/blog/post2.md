Selecting plants suited to your climate is crucial for garden success. Native plants are adapted to local weather and soil conditions, making them easier to care for. Consider how much sunlight your garden gets dailyâ€”some plants thrive in full sun, others prefer shade. Grouping plants with similar needs helps you water and maintain them efficiently. When you choose the right plants, you reduce stress on your garden and enjoy lush, flourishing greenery with less effort.

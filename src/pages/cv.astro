    ðŸŒ± Profile

With over a decade of hands-on experience in gardening, plant rescue, and sustainable landscape design, Iâ€™ve helped individuals, families, and businesses create thriving green spaces â€” indoors and out. My approach is rooted in understanding each plantâ€™s unique needs and each client's lifestyle, so every space grows with intention.

Whether Iâ€™m reviving a struggling pothos or designing a rooftop jungle, I believe gardening is more than aesthetics â€” it's a living, breathing practice of care.
